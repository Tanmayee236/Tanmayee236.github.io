							<p>As a part of my PhD, I am working on mathematical modelling of binary <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"> neutron star </a> mergers. 
								I have used the data visualization technique to communicate the validity of the results. 
								I have modified <a href = "https://lorene.obspm.fr/">  LORENE </a>,  an open source Initial Data code for generating simulations 
								of binary neutron star mergers. With the help of LORENE and data engineering techniques, I have maintained
								a data repository available<a href = "https://ccrg.rit.edu/content/data/bns-initial-data"> here </a>.  We have used 
								<a href = "http://einsteintoolkit.org/"> the Einstein Toolkit </a>
								with <a href = "http://astro.phys.wvu.edu/zetienne/ILGRMHD/index.html" >IllinoisGRMHD</a>, to dynamically  simulate  
								BNS configurations to validate the physical nature of the results.
							</p>
							<p>
						        To  see  the  evolution  of the merger,  we can plot distribution of different quantities specifically densities,  velocities,  
								and metric terms needed to classify whether matter remains bound or has become unbound from the binary.  
								We can keep track of the mass ejected from the merger and also determine the fate of the merger, whether it would result 
								into a neutron star or a black hole.  
								The above video depicts different stages of an unequal mass merger, with mass ratio 0.7 and each star having an 
								individual mass of 1.4 and 2.0 solar masses and having AP4 Equation of state. AP4
							    is a plain nuclear matter EOS and has a fairlyhigh upper mass limit of 2.23 solar masses. The initial separation distance 
								between the NSs is 37.5km. The units of density and time are geometrcic units.  
							</p>
							<p>

								We can see from the above vidoes that the merger ejects an extremely low density material which eventually bleeds off
								 of the surfaces of the NSs during our dynamical evolution. The ejecta seen in the initial part of merger is due to numerical 
								 effects, an artifact of the modelling of atmosphere. This numerical effect is small and can be ignored The mass loss from during 
								 and immediately after the merger, itself is a physical effect caused by tidal interactions between the two stars.
							</p>

							<p>
								As the evolution progresses the more massivestar slowly tears apart the less massive star. 
								Once they come into contact, we find that the remnant promptly collapses into a black hole (central black dot) surrounded 
								by a disk of bound material.

							<p>
								I have used the python package  <a href = "https://github.com/wokast/PyCactus" > PostCactus</a>, for plotting the 
								dostribution of densities.
